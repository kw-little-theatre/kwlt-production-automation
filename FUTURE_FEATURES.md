# Future Features

Tracked ideas for improving the KWLT Production Automation system.

## Planned

### Slack prompt for Readthrough date
After the last day of auditions, automatically post a message in the show's Slack channel asking the Stage Manager / Director to provide the readthrough date. When they reply (or fill in the Show Setup sheet), the system updates the timeline and activates the readthrough-dependent tasks.

**Why**: Readthrough date is almost never known far in advance and is typically determined after auditions. Making it optional at setup avoids forcing a guess, but we need a mechanism to collect it later.

**Complexity**: Medium — requires either a Slack app with message-reading capability, or a simpler "fill in the sheet and re-run" workflow with a Slack nudge.

### Season-level task automation
The Season Runbook (`KWLT Runbook Template_ Season`) has ~27 tasks that are currently not automated. These are board/committee-level tasks (rights acquisition, budgets, Eventbrite setup, etc.) that could follow the same anchor-date pattern with season-level anchor dates (board approval date, season announcement date, etc.).

---

### Slack reaction tracking
Monitor Slack reactions (e.g., ✅) on reminder messages and auto-mark tasks as Done. Requires upgrading from an incoming webhook to a full Slack app with `reactions:read` scope.

---

### Show support dashboard improvements
- Color-code the Season Overview by show
- Add a "days since last update" column
- Auto-highlight shows that haven't had any activity in 2+ weeks

---

### Repeated overdue reminders
Currently, overdue escalation fires once (2 days past deadline) then stops. Consider adding periodic follow-up reminders (e.g., every 3 days) for tasks that remain overdue, with escalating urgency. Wait to see how real-world usage goes before implementing.

---

### Board/committee-facing reminders
Some reminders are for the Show Support Committee or Board, not the production team. Examples: strike walkthrough volunteer coordination, debrief scheduling. These would need a separate routing path (to the show support channel or specific board members) rather than the show's Slack channel.

---

### Form-based date collection
For dates that aren't known at season setup (e.g., readthrough date, first production meeting date), provide a form or Slack prompt that the production team can fill in, which automatically updates the Show Setup sheet and activates the dependent tasks.

---

### Form-based debrief scheduling
After closing, automatically send a scheduling form (e.g., Doodle or Google Forms link) to the production team for the post-show debrief meeting, rather than requiring someone to do it manually.
